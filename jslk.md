# JSLK
JSLK is a simple 32-bit hobby kernel designed to run on the x86 architecture (although portability has been taken into consideration). It was started in August 2017 with the objective of learning how a computer operating system works and to improve the coding skills of the main developer. The kernel is mostly written in C with some bits of assembly and has partial compatibility with C++ (a small runtime is provided). Some of its features are: extensive HAL API, System V ABI compatibility, memory management, interrupt handling, VGA driver, timers and delays, some synchronization primitives, virtual memory, a VFS, RTC and Keyboard drivers, a growing home-made C library, etc.

**Latest release:** v0.0.8pa

**Currently working on:** v0.0.9pa
